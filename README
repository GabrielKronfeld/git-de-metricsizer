Commit *quality* not quaranteed. 



Step 1: make a cron job pointing to your project, running at a desired frequency. I suggest 4 times a day?
example: <in bash> crontab -e
        0 10,12,16,18 * * * ~/temp.txt
the above opens your table of cron jobs, automatically ran commands in Unix given the date.
left to right being the minute, hour, day-of-month, month, day-of-week, and the command to execute
the above example automatically executes the code in temp.txt every day at 10AM,12PM,4PM, and 6PM. 

make sure to replace the above with the times you want and the location of the de-metricsizer.py file! (and that you have python installed!)
